* As a guest user of WD Buzzwords, who is visiting the site for the first time, I want to understand easily what the site is about.
  - The Home page has a 'Welcome' section to offer new visitors more information on what this site is about. It also contains two sections with 
  call to action buttons to spark curiosity and lead visitors to the other pages of the website. The parallax image visually supports the content and adds interactivity to the page.

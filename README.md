### Structure
This website offers users the option to choose between the following two to accomodate their individual preferences:

* **Guest users** - (unauthenticated site visitors) can access selected functions in the navigation panel: Home, Glossary, Log In and Sign Up Pages.
* **Registered users** - once users decide to register to the website, they will be able to access full functionality and additionally access Account, Add Term and Log Out pages.

### Surface
* Color palette has been created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/4db6ac-ffc400-c2185b-e0e0e0-eeeeee) and materialize color classes have been used in this project.
* I have chosen a base color of teal and a complimentary color orange to create contrast to the site and add depth. By using this bold combination, I aimed to create an inviting and relaxing design for the users. A splash of pink has been added for a contrast and light grey has been used to display the flash messages.
